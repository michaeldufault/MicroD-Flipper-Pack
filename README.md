## MicroD Logo Animation
An animation for the Flipper which displays the MicroD logo on a static TV/CRT-style screen with passive and active animation loops. H/T [@Talking-Sasquatch](https://github.com/skizzophrenic/Talking-Sasquach) for his guides on the topic.<br/><br/>

Install by placing the entire `MicroD_Logo_Animation` folder in `ext/dolphin/` and adding it to the `manifest.txt` file.
For the `manifest.txt` file I recommend appending the following code:
```
Name: MicroD_Logo_128x64
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 13
Min level: 1
Max level: 30
Weight: 5
```
